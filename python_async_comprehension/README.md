# Python Async Comprehension

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous generators and comprehensions in Python. It includes three main tasks:

1. **Async Generator**: A coroutine that yields random numbers asynchronously
2. **Async Comprehensions**: A coroutine that collects random numbers using async comprehension
3. **Parallel Execution**: A coroutine that measures the runtime of parallel async comprehensions

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- All files must end with a new line
- All files must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.5.x)
- All modules and functions must have proper documentation
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated

## Files

- `0-async_generator.py`: Contains the async_generator coroutine
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Contains the async_comprehension coroutine
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Contains the measure_runtime coroutine

## Usage

Each file can be run independently using the provided main files. The examples demonstrate:
- Generating random numbers asynchronously
- Collecting random numbers using async comprehension
- Measuring parallel execution time of async comprehensions
